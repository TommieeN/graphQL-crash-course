## Overview üßëüèª‚Äçüíª 
This project serves as a practical exploration and learning experience in utilizing Apollo GraphQL. The focus of the project is on various aspects of GraphQL, including creating schemas and types, implementing resolver functions, handling QueryVariables, establishing relationships between data, and performing mutations for data manipulation. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of Apollo GraphQL through hands-on implementation.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key sections:

### Schemas and Types:
- Definition of GraphQL schemas and types to model the data structure.

### Resolver Functions:
- Implementation of resolver functions to handle GraphQL queries and resolve data fetching.

### QueryVariables:
- Integration of QueryVariables to enable dynamic querying and parameterized data retrieval.

### Data Relationships:
- Establishment of relationships between different data types, demonstrating the power of GraphQL in handling complex data structures.
- 
### Mutations:
- Implementation of mutation operations for creating, updating, and deleting data.

### Data Updates:
- Exploration of methods for updating data in real-time using GraphQL subscriptions or other relevant mechanisms.
